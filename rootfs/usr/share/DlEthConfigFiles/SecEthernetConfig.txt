#this is Sample Configuration file for secondary Ethernet Which is being used for communicating with PLC
#in this configuration file you can speciy following
#ip_address:<Ip address that you want to use> e.g. ip_address:192.168.0.12 in this section device will only take first 4 fields
#subnet_mask:<subnet number> e.g. 24, {24= 255.255.255.0} , {23= 255.255.254.0}
#port_number: <port in which plc is going to communicate with datalogger> e.g. 3333 {user can use port number from 1025 - 65535}
#one sample example 
ip_address:192.168.0.33
subnet_mask:24
port_number:3999
